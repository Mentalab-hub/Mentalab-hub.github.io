      <description>Here is a step-by-step guide on using explorepy and Openvibe to visualize multiple Mentalab Explore systems simultaneously.
  Start two Python consoles and activate a virtual environment for explorepy in both.
  Use the push2lsl command to stream data from your Explore device to lab streaming layer (one device per console).
  Open an Openvibe Acquisition server and select &amp;ldquo;Driver: LabStreamingLayer&amp;rdquo;. Go to the driver properties and select &amp;ldquo;EXG stream&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;marker signal&amp;rdquo; from one of the connected Explore devices.</description>

      <description>Synchronizing ExG signals with stimuli is critical to many research paradigms. There are two main approaches to synchronizing data: software event markers and hardware triggers.
Although software event markers are easy to use, they are not as precise as hardware triggers. This is because the data is sent via Bluetooth, which has some inherent delays.
Meanwhile, hardware triggers are much more precise but involve connecting a wire between devices (e.g. a computer and an Explore device).</description>
