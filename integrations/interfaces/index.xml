      <description>BrainFlow Integration BrainFlow is an open-source library that provides a unified interface for biosignal acquisition across a variety of hardware platforms. It simplifies the process of working with physiological signals such as EEG, EMG, and ECG by offering a consistent API in multiple programming languages including Python, C++, Java, and MATLAB.&#xA;What is BrainFlow? BrainFlow enables:&#xA;Seamless data access across supported biosignal devices Real-time signal processing tools (e.g., filtering, feature extraction) Integration into research workflows and custom applications Cross-platform development using high-level APIs For a deeper overview, visit the official BrainFlow documentation.</description>
