Here is a step-by-step guide on using `explorepy` and [OpenViBE](http://openvibe.inria.fr/) to visualize multiple Mentalab Explore systems simultaneously.

1. Start two Python consoles and activate a virtual environment for `explorepy` in both. 

2. Use the `push2lsl` command to stream data from your Explore device to [lab streaming layer](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html) (one device per console).

3. Open an OpenViBE __acquisition server__ and select "LabStreamingLayer" as the driver. Under "Driver Properties", select your Explore device's "ExG" and "Marker" streams, selecting only one of the connected Explore devices. Click "Apply" and "Connect". 

4. Open an OpenViBE __acquisition server__ server again, and select "LabStreamingLayer" as the driver again. Under "Driver Properties", select the "ExG" and "Marker" streams from your other connected Explore device. Use a different connection port this time by opening "Preferences" and changing the `TCP_Tagging_Port`. Click "Apply" and "Connect". 

5. Open the OpenViBE __designer__ and start a "New Project". Add two __acquisition clients__ from the "Boxes" menu. Make sure that their port numbers match the port numbers you set in the __acquisition servers__.

6. Add a "Signal Merger" to combine the signals and add a "Signal Display". Connect the two __acquisition clients__ into the merger, and then add the merger to the display (connect the pink triangles on the edges of the boxes).

7. Click "Play" and enjoy!
