Here is a step-by-step guide on using `explorepy` and [Openvibe](http://openvibe.inria.fr/) to visualize multiple Mentalab Explore systems simultaneously.

1. Start two Python consoles and activate a virtual environment for `explorepy` in both. 

2. Use the `push2lsl` command to stream data from your Explore device to [lab streaming layer](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html) (one device per console).

3. Open an __Openvibe Acquisition__ server and select "Driver: LabStreamingLayer". Go to the driver properties and select "EXG stream" and "marker signal" from one of the connected Explore devices. Click "Connect". 

4. Open an __Openvibe Acquisition__ server again, select "Driver: LabStreamingLayer". Go to the driver properties and select "EXG stream" and "marker signal" from the other connected Explore device. Use a different connection port this time by opening preferences and changing the `TCP_Tagging_Port`. Click "Connect". 

5. Open the __Openvibe Designer__ and start new project. Add two acquisition clients from the "Boxes" menu. Make sure that their port numbers match the port numbers you set in the Acquisition servers.

6. Add a signal merger to combine the signals and add a signal display. Connect the two acquisition clients into the merger, and then add the merger to the display (connect the pink triangles on the edges of the boxes).

7. Click "play" and enjoy!
