Record data in real time to EDF (BDF+) or CSV by selecting ‘Record’ on the Visualization page.

A pop-up will allow you to configure your recording.

Settings include:
- File format – select the output file type (EDF or CSV):
	- CSV mode generates an extra file for the marker events
	- EDF mode records data in BDF+ format (in 24-bit resolution)
- Folder and name prefix – select where to store files and the file prefix.	For example, if the prefix is ‘test’, data will record in 	three separate files: ‘test_ExG.csv’, ‘test_ORN.csv’, and ‘test_Marker.csv’. These files will contain ExG data, orientation data, and event markers.
- Recording time (in seconds) – set the duration of the recording. You can stop recording at any time by clicking ‘Stop’.- Filters.

{{< alert style="info" >}} Because environmental factors, like temperature, can affect your sampling rate, we recommend computing the sampling rate of your recorded data. If you find a deviation between the sampling rate you calculate and Explore Desktop’s sampling rate, resample your signal to correct for drifts. The timestamps in the CSV/EDF file can be used to compute the resampling factor. {{< /alert >}}

{{< alert style="info" >}} If you are setting markers in your recording, record to CSV. Alternatively, push data to LSL and record with LabRecorder. EDF cannot guarantee precise marker timings. {{< /alert >}}

## Event markers
One method to generate a marker event is to press the button on your Mentalab Explore device. Alternatively, you can set event markers using the ‘Set’ button. 

Marker events display as vertical dashed lines in the Visualize page. A corresponding event code will display.

{{< alert style="danger" >}} Marker codes between 0 and 7 are reserved for hardware. Please use any other integer (from 8 to 65535) as a code for your marker. {{< /alert >}}
