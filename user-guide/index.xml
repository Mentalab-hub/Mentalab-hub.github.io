      <description>Operating modes Mentalab Explore has two main operating modes: offline and online. When in offline mode, the amplifier collects data and stores it in internal flash memory. Users can extract the recordings from the memory using a USB-C cable after recording. In online mode, data is transmitted via Bluetooth in real-time to a host machine, enabling the user to collect, monitor, and visualize data. In this mode, you can also measure impedances, and configure the amplifier with Explore Desktop, explorepy, or Explore Mobile).</description>

      <description>Dry electrodes types Mentalab currently offers three types of dry electrodes.&#xA;Flat electrodes For electrode positions not covered by hair (e.g. on the forehead, mastoid…), our flat electrodes ensure optimal skin contact and comfort.&#xA;Brush electrodes Dry brush electrodes.&#xD;For areas covered in hair, we recommend using brush electrodes. Their flexible pins penetrate most hair types and establish good contact with the scalp. XL brush electrodes For very dense and curly hair types, we recommend using our XL brush electrodes for increased hair penetration.</description>

      <description>The Mentalab Explore amplifier was designed to provide maximum flexibility, with minimal size. This page lists how the amplifier communicates with the user via the LED diode.&#xA;LED Light Blinking Pattern Description Example Red / Yellow / Green Solid at amplifier start-up. Flashes for 3 secs Start-up in progress. Colour indicates battery status (green &amp;gt; 90%; yellow &amp;gt; 50%; red &amp;lt; 50%). Blue Blinks four times a second Bluetooth visible and advertising.</description>

      <title>Improving Impedances</title>
      <link>https://wiki.mentalab.com/user-guide/improving-impedances/</link>

      <description>Since the impedance at the REF electrode affects signal quality for all EEG channels, we recommend starting with the REF electrode.&#xA;General Always verify that there is good contact between electrode and scalp. Ensure all electrodes are being pulled onto the scalp by the cap and there are no creases in the cap causing electrodes to “float&amp;quot;.&#xA;A thin, elastic cap placed over the electrode cap can further reduce impedances. It presses gently on all electrodes, particularly in occipital positions.</description>

      <description>Mentalab’s flagship API, explorepy, is written in Python and is the most direct way to communicate with your Explore amplifier. It can be installed from the Python Packaging Index (PyPI) using pip and offers a range of commands that can be called from the command line, like setting the sampling rate or streaming data to the console.&#xA;For more information on explorepy, like how to install it, a detailed list of commands or how it can be used in your own Python scripts, please refer to the docs.</description>

      <description>While regularly disinfecting materials prevents contamination, please bear in mind that frequent disinfection will damage your equipment. If your equipment does not require immediate disinfection, consider using water-based cleaning.&#xA;Cleaning electrodes and caps Please clean caps and electrodes immediately after every use to prevent conductive gel residue from drying into the material.&#xA;Electrodes Clean electrodes with warm water and a soft material such as cotton or cotton swabs. Ensure that the connector always remains dry.</description>
