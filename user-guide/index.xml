      <description>We strongly recommend completing this checklist before you start collecting EEG data. This will ensure you get the best out of your Explore system.
1. Install software  Install the software appropriate for your needs. An overview of our open-source APIs can be found on the software page of our website or in our GitHub Repo. Regardless which software you use to record with, you will need explorepy to verify impedances.</description>

      <title>Dry Electrode Guide</title>
      <link>https://Mentalab-hub.github.io/user-guide/dry-electrode-guide/</link>

      <description>Dry electrodes types Mentalab currently offers three types of dry electrodes.
Flat electrodes For electrode positions not covered by hair (e.g. on the forehead, mastoid…), our flat electrodes ensure optimal skin contact and comfort.
Brush electrodes Dry brush electrodes.For areas covered in hair, we recommend using brush electrodes. Their flexible pins penetrate most hair types and establish good contact with the scalp. XL brush electrodes For very dense and curly hair types, we recommend using our XL brush electrodes for increased hair penetration.</description>

      <title>Improving Impedances</title>
      <link>https://Mentalab-hub.github.io/user-guide/improving-impedences/</link>

      <guid>https://Mentalab-hub.github.io/user-guide/improving-impedences/</guid>
      <description>Since the impedance at the REF electrode affects signal quality for all EEG channels, we recommend starting with the REF electrode.
General Always verify that there is good contact between electrode and scalp. Ensure all electrodes are being pulled into the scalp by the cap and there are no creases in the cap causing electrodes to “float&amp;quot;.
Gel electrodes  Apply conductive gel through the openings at the back of the electrodes with a blunt syringe.</description>

      <title>Cleaning, Disinfecting and Storing Mentalab Hardware</title>
      <link>https://Mentalab-hub.github.io/user-guide/cleaning-disinfection-storage/</link>

      <guid>https://Mentalab-hub.github.io/user-guide/cleaning-disinfection-storage/</guid>
      <description>While regularly disinfecting materials prevents contamination, please bear in mind that frequent disinfection will damage your equipment. If your equipment does not require immediate disinfection, consider using water-based cleaning.
Cleaning electrodes and caps Please clean caps and electrodes immediately after every use to prevent conductive gel residue from drying into the material.
Electrodes Clean electrodes with warm water and a soft material such as cotton or cotton swabs. Ensure that the connector always remains dry.</description>
