## Before recording
1. Before recording EEG data, please do consult our [EEG Checklist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3ZD1WwE140&list=PLa3JycsGtkBiwTe02KE-UPoF3wmB2RHZU). This will ensure you get the best performance out of your system.

2. Working with dry electrodes can be challenging. As such, we compiled a [dry electrode guide]({{< ref "/User Guide/3-dry-electrode-guide" >}} "User Guide/Dry Electrode Guide") to help you setup and improve the impedances of your dry electrodes.

3. We have a host of [software APIs](https://fyi.cpg.mybluehost.me/software-integrations/) for you to integrate with your Explore system. Our flagship API is `explorepy`, a Python library. To install `explorepy`, please consult our [`explorepy` Installation Guide](https://explorepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) or use our [Windows installer](https://github.com/Mentalab-hub/explorepy/releases/tag/v1.6.0).
For an overview of `explorepy` commands, please see our [documentation](https://explorepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html), or watch our short [`explorepy` tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3ZD1WwE140&list=PLa3JycsGtkBiwTe02KE-UPoF3wmB2RHZU).

## During recording
To aid your research, we've created some Mentalab Explore cheat sheets, which you can refer to as you experiment. One is an [LED light guide]({{< ref "/User Guide/4-led-light-guide" >}} "User Guide/LED Light Guide"), which explains how the Explore device will communicate with you. The other is a [button command table]({{< ref "/User Guide/5-button-guide" >}} "User Guide/Button Command Guide"), which you can use to control the Explore device.

## After recording
To maximise the lifespan of your ExG system, it is important to prevent damage to your equipment. 

We have compiled instructions on [caring for your Mentalab Hardware]({{< ref "/User Guide/8-cleaning-storage-guide" >}} "User Guide/Cleaning, Disinfecting and Storing Mentalab Hardware") to help you do this.
