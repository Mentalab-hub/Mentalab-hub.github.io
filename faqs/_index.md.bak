---

## General
<br>
{{< collapse title="What does ExG mean?" >}} ExG is a term used to summarize all electrograms: EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, and EGG. Whatever ExG you are using, Mentalab has the appropriate caps, electrodes, and cables. In fact, depending on your set-up, a single Mentalab Explore system can handle different electrograms simultaneously, as long as they use a shared reference.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Can the Mentalab Explore device record EEG and ECG at the same time?" >}} Combining ECG and EEG recording is possible. However, both electrograms must share the same reference electrode, which may affect EEG signal quality. To minimize this effect, put the ground electrode on the scalp (not chest) and measure ECG with respect to that. The remaining cross talk will be: <br>10Hz input : -64dB <br>25Hz input : -75dB {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Can I use my standard ECG or EMG electrodes with the device?" >}} Yes, our Clip9 and Clip5 cables can connect to standard stick and peel electrodes as long as they have a little conductive knob on the back. {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="My device won't turn on - it just flashes and turns off! What should I do?" >}} <p>The internal memory of your Explore device is full. The Explore device will refuse to record any more data while its memory is full. To solve this, either transfer the data from your Explore device to a computer, or double click your Explore device. Double-clicking the button will delete the internal memory of your Explore device and allow you to start recording. See our <a href="/user-guide/led-light-guide">Light Guide</a> and <a href="/user-guide/button-guide">Button Guide</a> for more.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Where are my recorded files stored?" >}} <p>Recorded files are saved in the current command line folder. The default locations are: </p> <p> <ul><li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\USER_NAME</code> <li>Ubuntu: <code>/home/USER_NAME</code> <li>Mac OSX: <code>/Users/USER_NAME</code></ul></p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Can one channel act as a reference for a subset of other channels?" >}} <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart/lightning">LabChart Lightning</a> can perform custom calculations like this live. This cannot be done in <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code> directly, but it can be achieved with basic post-processing. Simply subtract the signal of the second reference channel from the subset of other channels. As a result, the values for these other channels will look as if they were recorded against the second reference.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

### Science
<br>
{{< collapse title="How can I use my Explore device with infants?" >}} <p> Choose a XS, XS/S, or S cap, as there is a lot of variability between infants. Remove the chin strap for added comfort, and use tights, stretched out over EEG cap, to keep electrodes in place if need be. For more on infant EEG research, check out our <a href="https://mentalab.com/infant-eeg-markers/">blog post</a> on the subject.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="I want to remove artifacts from muscle/gait/ocular research, where ICA doesn't work. Any advice?" >}} <p> Unfortunately, we cannot help with data processing, as this is the responsibility of the research group. However, we can provide resources as needed. For instance, have a look at <a href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Artifact_Subspace_Reconstruction_(ASR)">Artifact Subspace Reconstruction</a> and automated correction methods like <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/publications/schloegl2007eog.pdf">this</a>. For more information on noise removal, check out our <a href="https://mentalab.com/reduce-noise-in-eeg-recordings/">blog post</a> on the subject. </p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How can I create a bipolar montage with my system, when it has a unipolar reference?" >}} <p> With ease! Simply subtract your second reference channel from the other channels. This can be done in <a href="http://openvibe.inria.fr/">OpenViBE</a> or a Python script. For more, please reach out to us at <a href="support@mentalab.com">support@mentalab.com</a> </p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

## Hardware
<br>
{{< collapse title="What is the size of the internal storage and can I record offline?" >}} The internal storage has 512MB. When recording with 8 channels, you can record for the following times:<br> ~13.7 hours at 250 Hz<br>~8.8 hours at 500 Hz<br>~3.98 hours at 1 kHz{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="What sampling rates does Explore offer?" >}} ExG data is recorded at 250/500/1000 Hz (users' choice), but visualized at 125 Hz; orientation data is both recorded and visualized at 20 Hz.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="What hardware filters are used in the Explore system?" >}} ADS applies a 3rd order sinc filter as an anti-aliasing filter. The cut-off frequencies depend on the sampling rate.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="The participant's head is not moving, but one line of the accelerometer at -1000 and not 0. Why is this?" >}} <p> The accelerometer measures <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration">gravitational acceleration</a> (<i>G</i>: ~9.8 m/s/s) and the device's relative acceleration. Most of the time, the acceleration of the device relative to <i>G</i> is tiny, which means one accelerometer line will be offset by <i>G</i>. Which of the three lines is offset depends on the orientation of the device.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How does the magnetometer work?" >}} The magnetometer is a piezoelectric sensor. To be more explicit, Mentalab Explore has a built-in magnet which, like a compass, measures the external magnetic field applied to it. Earth's magnetic field creates a coordinate system that moves with the device (since the magnetometer is located in the device). We are interested in the orientation of this magnetic field so that we can build a fixed coordinate system. {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Is my Mentalab Explore device DC coupled?" >}} Yes. The Mentalab Explore device is always DC-coupled. However, do note that its working range is Â±400mV.  {{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

### Usage
<br>
{{< collapse title="What do all the LED colors mean on my Mentalab Explore device?" >}} <p>The LED color and blinking pattern convey relevant information about your device's status. A complete list can be found in our <a href="../user-guide/led-light-guide/">LED Light Guide</a>.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How do I use the button to send commands to the device?" >}} <p>The single button can be used to send a number of commands to the device. A complete list of button commands can be found in our <a href="../user-guide/button-guide/">Button Command Guide</a>.</p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How long does it take to fully charge the battery?" >}} A full charge takes about 2 hours depending on the charger and environmental conditions. {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="If I leave my device plugged in and charging for weeks, will it damage the battery?" >}} <p>If you leave your Explore device plugged in when it is fully charged, there will be some decline in its battery capacity. We recommend unplugging your device after each full charge, which normally takes 2 hours. If your battery has declined so much that it is unusable, please contact us at <a href="support@mentalab.com">support@mentalab.com</a> and we can repair or replace your device's battery.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Is there a way to measure impedances?" >}} <p><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy </a>our free in-house software, offers a feature that will indicate impedance values for individual channels to verify good signal quality before you start recording.</p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

### Integration
<br>
{{< collapse title="How do I combine Mentalab Explore with other hardware while using a single trigger across all devices?" >}} <p>If you want synchronize data streams from different hardware components, we recommend using software platforms specifically designed for this. <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code> can push data to <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html">lab streaming layer</a> and <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart/lightning">LabChart Lightning</a> has built-in multi device support. </p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Can more than one device be used simultaneously with the same receiver?" >}} <p>Yes, if you use <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart/lightning">LabChart Lightning</a>. Other software solutions support multiple devices but it requires a few additional steps. A step-by-step guide using <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code>, <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html">lab streaming layer</a>, and <a href="http://openvibe.inria.fr/">Openvibe</a> can be found under the <a href="../integrations/"> Integrations</a> section.</p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

### Connection
<br>
{{< collapse title="My computer doesn't have Bluetooth. How can I connect the Mentalab Explore device?" >}} <p>You can add Bluetooth capability to your computer using an inexpensive Bluetooth dongle that plugs into the computer's USB port. We recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controllers-UB400/dp/B07V1SZCY6">this one</a>.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Why can't my computer connect to my Explore device?" >}} Some computer Bluetooth modules (e.g. Realtek 8821C) are known to have issues with the serial port profile (SPP). If you face connection issues, please use an external Bluetooth dongle (of "plug & play" type) instead.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Why does the internal memory of Explore not appear on my computer?" >}} Please check whether your device has an in-built flash memory. To do this, look at your device's Bluetooth ID. This can be found on the sticker at the back of the device. The Bluetooth ID should have a code that contains a 1 in the 6th digit: xxxxx1/CCCC. <br> Check that you are using a USB cable that can transmit data. Use the cable provided by Mentalab and try different USB ports on your machine. The memory should appear as an external drive. Should the problem persist, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mentalab.com">support@mentalab.com </a>{{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

### Accessories
<br>
{{< collapse title="What material are the dry electrodes made of?" >}} Our dry electrodes are made of a conductive carbon-filled polymer with AgCl-coating. This material feels similar to soft rubber. The combination provides high comfort with great conductivity.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="What is the life expectancy of my cables and electrodes?" >}} The life expectancy of your equipment depends on how you care for it. Under optimal conditions, you can use your materials for 10 years or longer. We provide a 2 year warranty on both cables and electrodes, and have tested these components for 200 sessions without degredation.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How does combining REF and GND into a single electrode work?" >}} The Mentalab Explore system combines REF and GND electrodes into a single channel. This is possible because the device is so mobile, which means it doesn't draw heavy noise from the power line. Since we have short cable lengths, we can afford not to use a bias current and connect the ground to the "mass" shield of the PCB.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Which Bluetooth version does the Explore system use?" >}} Mentalab Explore uses Bluetooth Classic 2.1 embedded SPP profile to maximize data throughput and provide higher sampling rates.{{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

## Software
<br>
{{< collapse title="Will your device work with my software?" >}} <p>Please see the <a href="../integrations/"> Integrations</a> section for a complete list of analysis software that works with Mentalab Explore. As a general guideline, our open source API <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code> can push data directly to <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html">lab streaming layer</a>, and we have integrations for Java, MATLAB, and C++. We are also fully integrated with <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart/lightning">LabChart Lightning</a>. If you would like to build your own integration, we provide an open source SDK and our technical team is always happy to help.</p> {{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Can data be streamed to online analysis platforms?" >}} Transmission to cloud storage has been tested successfully. For more details, please contact our support.{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How do event triggers work? Can they be synchronized with other devices?" >}} <p>The time stamps generated by the Mentalab Explore device are very precise. There is a slight yet consistent delay of ~50ms because of how Bluetooth works. Syncing with other devices can be done using third-party software, like <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html">lab streaming layer</a> and <a href="https://www.adinstruments.com/products/labchart/lightning">LabChart Lightning</a>. Please contact support for more detailed information on the topic. </p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="How is recorded data stored?" >}} <p>All data is stored in CSV or EDF format. Filters that are applied in <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code> only affect visualization. The recorded data files will always contain raw data. Files recorded with<code> explorepy </code>are saved in the current command line folder. By default this is <code>C:\Users\&#10094;USER_NAME&#10095;</code> on Windows; <code>/home/&#10094;USER_NAME&#10095;</code> on Ubuntu; and <code>/Users/&#10094;USER_NAME&#10095;</code> on Mac. You can record data in other formats using and other third-party software solutions that supports <a href="https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html">lab streaming layer</a> (e.g. LabRecorder, OpenVibe etc.). </p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br><br>

{{< collapse title="How do I use explorepyâs command line input to communicate with the device?" >}} <p>You can find an overview as well as a detailed list of available command line inputs in our <a href="../user-guide/explorepy-commands/">explorepy Command Guide</a>. </p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="Why is the visualization in explorepy not working properly?" >}} <p>To use the <code><a href="https://explorepy.readthedocs.io">explorepy</a></code> dashboard, use Chrome as your default browser and make sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements for real-time<code> explorepy </code>visualization. These are: Dual-core CPU with 2.5 GHz or faster and 1GB+ of available RAM (6GB recommended). </p>{{< /collapse >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< collapse title="What command line terminals are compatible with explorepy?" >}} <p>You can use <code>explorepy</code> from most Python command terminals. However, we do recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> to manage your virtual environment dependencies, and <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/">Anaconda prompt</a> to run custom Python scripts. If you use the executable installer, you can also operate <code>explorepy</code> from a Windows command prompt. </p><p>We have heard reports that some terminals do not run <code>explorepy</code> smoothly. These terminals include:<ul><li>Spyder Shell<li>Jupyter Notebook Shell</ul></p> {{< /collapse >}}
