      <description>This list contains EEG analysis software that can import Mentalab Explore data.
In general, many EEG analysis pipelines use EDF file formats. To convert your Mentalab Explore data to EDF, please use the bin2edf command available in our open source API explorepy. If your device has internal memory, it will automatically save data to BIN. If you are using the Bluetooth feature of your Mentalab Explore device, be sure to record to BIN and not CSV on the connected device.</description>

      <description>Dry electrodes types Mentalab currently offers three types of dry electrodes.
Flat electrodes For electrode positions not covered by hair (e.g. on the forehead, mastoid…), our flat electrodes ensure optimal skin contact and comfort.
Brush electrodes  Dry brush electrodes.For areas covered in hair, we recommend using brush electrodes. Their flexible pins penetrate most hair types and establish good contact with the scalp. XL brush electrodes For very dense and curly hair types, we recommend using our XL brush electrodes for increased hair penetration.</description>

      <description>Synchronizing ExG signals with stimuli is critical to many research paradigms. There are two main approaches to synchronizing data: software event markers and hardware triggers.
Although software event markers are easy to use, they are not as precise as hardware triggers. This is because the data is sent via Bluetooth, which has some inherent delays.
Meanwhile, hardware triggers are much more precise but involve connecting a wire between devices (e.g. a computer and an Explore device).</description>

      <description>Steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are commonly used in neuroscience and BCI research.
SSVEPs are brain signals that occur in response to a visual stimulus flickering at a fixed frequency (typically 3-75 Hz). A rhythmic stimulus can entrain brain activity in the occipital lobe, which is commonly associated with the visual cortex.
Here, we show you how to use Mentalab Explore with SSVEP-based classification tasks. The code is open-source and available here.</description>

      <description>Since the impedance at the REF electrode affects signal quality for all EEG channels, we recommend starting with the REF electrode.
General Always verify that there is good contact between electrode and scalp. Ensure all electrodes are being pulled into the scalp by the cap and there are no creases in the cap causing electrodes to “float&amp;quot;.
Gel electrodes  Apply conductive gel through the openings at the back of the electrodes with a blunt syringe.</description>

Although it provides comprehensive information about electrical processes inside the heart, the number of electrodes and the long distance between them makes 12-lead ECG impractical and uncomfortable.
